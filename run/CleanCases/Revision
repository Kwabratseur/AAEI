* Measured speed is 0.87+1.01/2 =0.94 m/s with a grating of 50% transparancy so -0.4 is actually accurate!
  30 m3/h from BCS -> 0.008333 m3/s
  Speed = Qin/(0.25*0.25*0.5) = 0.26666666666666666
  Speed set to -0.13 from -0.4. Outlet will naturally follow.

* Ozone must be set to 1e-6
* Check rate constant for secondary reaction, formaldehyde concentrations are high...
  A reaction 2 changed to  1.3689122798608136e9; from 2.186136661679339e10.
* Added functionObjects to calculate averages on the fly.

* Initializing one hour running simulation, most equivalent to measurements taken
* Try to use OF postprocessing.

* Discovered that LocalEuler DDT scheme should be ONLY used for steady state, not for transient!
* Switched to CrankNicolson 0.9 (blend between CN and Euler) for STL simulation
* Rerunning 2h of Kazuhide case 4 2D on old desktop with Euler DDT

* Cases in Thesis/STL_Cases
* New case mentioned below is: STL_Cases/STL_Limonene_ke/
* Creating new case with all components set to 0 at outlet, so actual backflow can only occur from components that enter the outlet.
* Also remove CH2O emission and reaction.
* Also attempt at another fieldAverage window to calculate average concentrations on the fly.
* fieldAverage functionObject only works for time-averaging, not for volume-time-averaging.
* volFieldValue should be able to do this.
* this works and outputs:

volFieldValue volFieldValue1 write:
    volAverage() of Cprod = 2.50904e-10
    volAverage() of C10H16 = 2.07334e-08
    volAverage() of O3 = 6.35788e-08

* Started new case with Co 0.5, Write 1s and CrankNicolson 0.9, most complete case.
* Rerun base case with above settings

29-11-2021 10:30:00
* Created new AfterClean case
* Initialize P, P_RGH, U fields with 3600s result,
* run for 900s
* after 900s deactivate limonene emission
* simulate another 2700s

2-1-2022 18:52:00
* Prepared STL_Limonene_Cprod_CHCO_ke_rerun simulation
* minor changes in 0 directory, initial conditions for gas concentrations set to $internalfield for almost everything except for explicit definitions
* CrankNicolson 0.9 writetime 1.0s
